# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
Database for solved exercises on multiple topics (strings, arrays, recursion, dp, trees, etc). There also snippets to help you understand the reasoning behind them. 

Legacy sections contains several exercises in their old format. I'm working on moving everything to a more readable one.
For every exercise you will find both the algorithm and some base test cases (WIP) to make sure you can modify it to your taste and have some assurance it's still working as intented!

Most exercises were taken from HackerRank/Codewars/LeetCode/GeeksForGeeks/ and other similar websites.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me and I'll do my best to help you :)
